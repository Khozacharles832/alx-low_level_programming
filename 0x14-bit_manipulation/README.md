0x14-bit_manipulation

0. Write a function that converts a binary nmber to an unsigned int 
	.Where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
	.Return: the converted number, or 0 if
	.there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1

1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number

2. 10
	.Write a funcxtion that returns the value of a bit at a given index
	.Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
	.Returns: the value of the bit at index or -1 if an error occured
3. 11
	.Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
	.Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
	.Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occured

4. 100
	.Write a function that sets the value of a bits to 0 at agiven index
	.Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
	.Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occured

5. 101
	.Write a function that returns the number of bits you would neesds to
	.flip to get from one number to another
	.You are not allowed to use the % or / operation
